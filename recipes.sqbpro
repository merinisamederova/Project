Homemade egg noodles – 300 g (or wide flat pasta)

Black pepper – to taste
Bay leaf – 2
Fresh parsley or dill – for garnish
Optional: boiled sausage-like kazy (horse meat sausage) – sliced', 'Place the meat into a large pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a gentle boil. Skim off the foam as it appears, then add salt, bay leaves, and black pepper. Simmer over low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours, until the meat becomes tender and easily separates from the bone. Remove the meat and keep it warm. Strain the broth and keep it hot. In a separate pot, cook the homemade noodles in some of the strained broth until soft but not mushy, then drain. In a pan, sauté the onion rings with a ladle of hot broth until soft and translucent — this will be the zhuush (onion sauce). To serve, arrange the noodles on a large platter, place the boiled meat (and kazy slices, if used) on top, and pour some of the hot onion sauce over everything. Sprinkle with herbs. Serve the remaining broth in bowls on the side. Traditionally eaten by hand — ''beshbarmak'' literally means ''five fingers''.', 150, 4.5, 'Nurgul', 1, '/static/images/dishes/beshbarmak.jpg'),
