    "ingredients": [
      "Lamb, beef, or horse meat – 700 g (with bones preferred)",
      "Onions – 3 large (sliced into thin rings)",
      "Homemade egg noodles – 300 g (or wide flat pasta)",
      "Water – 2.5 liters",
      "Salt – to taste",
      "Black pepper – to taste",
      "Bay leaf – 2",
      "Fresh parsley or dill – for garnish",
      "Optional: boiled sausage-like kazy (horse meat sausage) – sliced"
    ],
    "instructions": "Place the meat into a large pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a gentle boil. Skim off the foam as it appears, then add salt, bay leaves, and black pepper. Simmer over low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours, until the meat becomes tender and easily separates from the bone. Remove the meat and keep it warm. Strain the broth and keep it hot. In a separate pot, cook the homemade noodles in some of the strained broth until soft but not mushy, then drain. In a pan, sauté the onion rings with a ladle of hot broth until soft and translucent — this will be the zhuush (onion sauce). To serve, arrange the noodles on a large platter, place the boiled meat (and kazy slices, if used) on top, and pour some of the hot onion sauce over everything. Sprinkle with herbs. Serve the remaining broth in bowls on the side. Traditionally eaten by hand — 'beshbarmak' literally means 'five fingers'.",

      "Lamb or beef – 400 g (finely chopped, not minced)",
      "Onions – 2 large (finely diced)",
      "All-purpose flour – 400 g",
      "Butter or margarine – 100 g (cold, cubed)",
      "Water – 150 ml (cold)",
      "Salt – 1 tsp for dough, plus to taste for filling",

      "Cumin seeds – 1 tsp",
      "Sesame seeds – for topping (optional)",
      "Egg yolk – 1 (for brushing)"
    ],
    "instructions": "To prepare the dough, mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the cold butter and rub it into the flour until crumbly. Gradually pour in cold water and knead into a firm dough. Wrap it in plastic and let it rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: finely chop the meat (do not grind it), mix with diced onions, salt, black pepper, and cumin. Divide the dough into small balls, roll each out thinly, and brush lightly with oil or melted butter. Roll the dough into a log, slice into spirals, then roll each spiral flat again — this creates flaky layers. Place a spoonful of filling in the center, fold the edges to form a triangle or square, and seal well. Brush the tops with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle sesame seeds if desired. Bake on a parchment-lined tray at 200°C (390°F) for 25–30 minutes, until golden and crisp. Serve hot with tea or ayran.",

    "instructions": "Rinse the rice in cold water several times until the water runs clear, then soak it for 20–30 minutes. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or kazan over medium-high heat. Add the meat and fry until browned on all sides. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden. Stir in the carrots and cook for another 5–7 minutes until they soften slightly. Season with salt, black pepper, and cumin. Pour in the hot water or broth to cover the meat and vegetables. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until the meat is tender. Carefully add the soaked rice on top, spreading it evenly — do not stir. Add more water so that it covers the rice by about 1–2 cm. Place a whole head of garlic in the center if desired. Cook uncovered on medium heat until the water is mostly absorbed, then reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and steam for 15–20 minutes. Remove from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes. Before serving, gently mix the rice with the meat and vegetables. Serve hot.",
